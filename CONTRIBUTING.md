# Contributing to Flowork

We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to Flowork, the self-hosted AI workflow automation platform focused on user data sovereignty. As an open-core project, we rely on the community for both growth and innovation.

**Important Note:** The Core Logic and Engine run on the user's local server to preserve privacy and data sovereignty. Therefore, contributions that focus on **robust local execution** and **security enhancements** are highly valued.

## How to Contribute?

There are many ways you can help, not just by writing code.

### üêõ 1. Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug or an unexpected failure, please report it via our GitHub Issues page.

2.  **Usage Scenario:** Provide specific examples of how the new feature would be used by the end-user.
3.  **Avoid Duplication:** Verify that a similar feature proposal does not already exist.

### üíª 3. Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

We accept Pull Requests (PRs) for bug fixes, feature enhancements, and new Modules/Plugins.

1.  **Fork and Clone:** Fork the Flowork repository to your GitHub account and clone it locally.
2.  **Create a New Branch:** Always work on a new, descriptively named branch (e.g., `fix/name-of-bug` or `feat/new-feature-name`).
3.  **Code Style Compliance:** Ensure your code adheres to the *linting* and *formatting* standards used in the project (we use Python, please ensure PEP 8 style).
4.  **Unit Tests:** Include or update relevant unit tests for your code changes.
5.  **Update Documentation:** If your change affects how a Module, Plugin, or Tool works, update the relevant documentation (including the `locales/en.json` file if user-facing text is changed).

## ü§ù Architectural Consultation

If you plan to implement major architectural changes (e.g., modifying how the proxy works or inter-Engine communication), please open a **Discussion** first. We want to ensure Flowork remains agile, secure, and compatible with its massive self-hosted scalability goal.
