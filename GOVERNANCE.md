# Flowork Project Governance

Flowork operates under an **Open-Core** model, balancing the need for a robust, open-source core with a sustainable commercial future. This document outlines how the Flowork project is managed, how decisions are made, and the pathway for contributors to gain greater responsibility.

## ü§ù Project Roles

* **Users:** Individuals who deploy and operate the Flowork software.
* **Contributors:** Anyone who submits a code change, documentation correction, bug report, or feature request (via PRs, Issues, etc.).
* **Core Maintainers:** Developers with commit access to the core repository, responsible for guiding architectural direction, reviewing and merging contributions, and releasing stable versions.

## üèõÔ∏è Decision Making Process

All decisions related to the **Core** components (Kernel, Gateway, Core Services, Base Modules/Tools) are made with the following principles:

1.  **Prioritize Self-Host:** Decisions must prioritize user data sovereignty, ease of local deployment, and high local performance.
2.  **Consensus:** Major architectural or philosophical changes require consensus among the Core Maintainers.
3.  **Community Input:** Input from active Contributors, especially concerning bug fixes and usability improvements, is heavily weighed.

### Core Architectural Decisions (CAD)

For significant changes (e.g., database migration, changing core protocols, major licensing shifts), a **Core Architectural Decision (CAD)** process will be followed:
1.  **Proposal:** A Core Maintainer drafts a detailed proposal (often as a GitHub Discussion).
2.  **Review:** A minimum 14-day review period for community feedback.
3.  **Resolution:** Maintainers vote or reach consensus, and the decision is documented and merged into the repository.

## ü™ú Path to Becoming a Core Maintainer

Contributors are invited to become Core Maintainers based on demonstrated sustained commitment and technical expertise:

1.  **Initial Contribution:** Successfully merged 5+ non-trivial Pull Requests (PRs).
2.  **Trusted Contributor:** Consistently engaging in Issue triage, providing constructive code reviews, and maintaining a high standard of code quality over a 6-month period.
3.  **Invitation:** Trusted Contributors who show strong leadership and alignment with the Flowork philosophy may be invited to become a Core Maintainer by the existing Maintainer team.
